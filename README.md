# Instagram AutoPoster ‚Äì Reviewer Instructions

## üîç Use Case Overview

This app is a Python CLI tool that automates the posting of short-form video content to our business's Instagram account. It runs on a private server via scheduled cron jobs and uses the Instagram Graph API to upload videos stored in a secure AWS S3 bucket. This is an internal tool used only by our brand.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Test Instructions (Manual Testing of API Flow)

Although the app runs via cron automation in production, reviewers can manually test the full Instagram posting workflow as follows:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockvest/instagram-autoposter.git
cd instagram-autoposter

2. Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a .env File

Provide valid access token and environment configuration:

S3_BUCKET=drews-instagram-bucket
REGION=us-east-1
AWS_PROFILE=instagram-poster
TEST_VIDEO_KEY=Animation Reels by The Digital Era page (314).mp4

4. Run the One-Time Test Script
